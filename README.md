This is the simple calculator created using tkinter in python .
It can perform different function such as addition subtraction multiplication and so on 
I have imported everything from  tkinter library as you can see in the begining of the project . I have set the tittle as Digital calculator  I have used the three widgets here i.e button ,entry and text also used the grid method as a tkinter geometry .


Here Tk() is a class which is used to create the basic window , First thing first we have to make sure that  button gets when clicked so, i used click function .Different typres of functions such as add , sub, mul and so on are used to do its own types of operation . I have used lamda function here which is used in mathematical calculation also called as individual dependant . It is not required to define the lambda function as others what it is supposed to do is when we assign something it directly helps to assign that value .

As we have inserted different  operators we need to perform different mathematical operation so ,I have used the if condition .Like : iF i get to click the + button i will do the adding operation. To run this calculator smoothly evey buttons should do its own function & to beautifully appearing button i have assigned where and in which column we have to spotted this button .
