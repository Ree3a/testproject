This is the simple calculator created using tkinter in python .
It can perform different function such as addition subtraction multiplication and so on 
I have imported everything from  tkinter library as you can see in the begining of the project . I have used the three widgets here i.e button ,entry and text also used the grid method as a tkinter geometry .
Here Tk() is a class which is used to create the basic window , Different typres of functions and parameters are define here to run this claculator smoothly .
